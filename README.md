# Monte Carlo Stock Simualtion 


## Project overview
This project implements a **Monte Carlo Simulation** to model **stock price paths**
using Python. The simulation  randomly generates possible future prices based on
historiucal volatility and expected return, demonstrating probabilistic forecasting
in financial markets


## Key Features
- Simulates multiple stock price paths over a defined time horizon
- Visualizes results with plots of simulated paths
- Calculates expected returns and probabilities of reaching certain price levels
- Uses **NumPy** for numerical computations and **Matplotlib** for visualization

## Skills & Tools
- Python programming
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Quantitative finance concepts
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- Numerical computations with NumPy

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
